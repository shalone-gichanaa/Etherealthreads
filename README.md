## Project Overview
**Ethereal Threads** is a stylish online thrift shop selling women’s boots, clothing, and accessories.  
This web application is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Users can **browse products**, **filter by category**, and **add new products** via a simple form. All product data is stored in the browser using **localStorage**, so changes are reflected dynamically across pages.



## Features
- **Homepage:** Hero section introducing the store.  
- **Products Page:** Displays all products dynamically. Filter by **Clothing** or **Accessories**.  
- **Add Product Page:** Add a product name, category, price, and image.  
- **Delete Products:** Remove items directly from the products page.  
- **Responsive Design:** Works on **desktop, tablet, and mobile**.  
- **About Page:** Learn about the store’s story, values, and mission.  



## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure for accessibility and organization.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, Grid & Flexbox layouts, hover effects, and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage management.  



## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Browse **Products** to see the collection.  
4. Navigate to **Add Product** to add a new item:  
   - Enter **Product Name**  
   - Select **Category**  
   - Enter **Price**  
   - Upload **Image**  
   - Click **Add Product**  
5. Check the **Products Page** to view the newly added item.  
6. Click the **Delete** button to remove any product.  


## Known Issues
- Image uploads are limited to one per product.  
- Products stored in **localStorage** are only saved on the same browser/device.  
- Delete functionality may require refreshing in some cases.  



## Future Improvements
- Add category-specific product pages (e.g., Boots only).  
- Implement **search functionality**.  
- Integrate a **database** or backend for cross-device persistence.  
- Enhance form validation and error handling.
